This is a project I made for a course in freecodecamp.org. This is the first of 5 final projects; it's a tribute page that I had to copy from an original tribute page made by them. This is the link to the original tribute page: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx. 

I also had some User Stories given for me to develop this page:

*User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
*User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
*User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
*User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
*User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
*User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
*User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
*User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
*User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

My page passed the exam on freecodecamp.org. I'm glad for that, but I surely know I can do it better, and I hope I will with more practice. Specially in Style.

All feedback is welcomed and highly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

P.S: I'm also kinda new to Github, so any feedback and/or recommendation about it is also welcome!
